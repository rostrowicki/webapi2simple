# webapi2simple
Simple example of using WebAPI2 with JQuery frontend

Solution contains 2 different projects:
* ProductsApp
WebAPI2 + jQuery
Hint: nteresting code snippet here - I've added custom jQuery plugin that might be attached to the input field to detect Enter press key

* BookService
WebAPI2 + EF6 + bootstrap + knockoutJS
More advance example - it has user interface implemented in knockoutJS.
